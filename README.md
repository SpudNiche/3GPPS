# 3GPPS
"3G Ping-Pong Standings"

# Overview
The 3GPPS is a project for ECE 435 (Network Engineering). It's a project that remotely logs ping-pong game outcomes to a database via a 3G IoT board.

A "Particle Electron" IoT development board with some buttons/leds wired up to it will be the remote part of the project. The user will submit ping-pong game outcomes using the Electron. A Raspberry Pi 3 will host a database and webpage that logs the data coming in from the Electron. The Particle development environment, SQLite, and lighttpd will be use to develop the various components of the project.
